# React-3x3-Interactive-Matrix-with-Sequential-Color-Transition
This React project implements a 3x3 interactive matrix where users can click on any box to change its color to green. Once all nine boxes have been clicked, they sequentially transition to orange in the order they were originally clicked. The project demonstrates state management, event handling, and dynamic UI updates in React.
